1)	MATLAB Test Case Files: The MATLAB files included contain three seperate sensor array model test cases
	seperated into named foldesr. Each folder contains a .m driver file that runs either 1) the Greedy 		
	algorithm 2) the Metropolis algorithm or 3) Genetic algorithm in the chosen test case. By default the files will
	provide one test sample automatically in the corresponding directory according to the stopping critera 
	set – either time based or performance based In order to increase the number of test samples, 
	the primary loop must be uncommented.Furthermore, in order to remove or add bounded excitation current vectors,
	the corresponding code must be commented/uncommented accordingly.The stopping criteria must also be 
	changed according to the parameters that are being tested in
	each of the simulations. This may either be time based or performance based.

2)	Thesis:The corresponding thesis in .pdf format is included.
